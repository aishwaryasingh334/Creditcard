Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The model classifies transactions as either fraudulent or genuine based on features extracted from transaction data.

Key Features:
Dataset used: [Dataset name or source, e.g., "Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset" from Kaggle]
Machine learning models used: [e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest]
Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Ensure that Python 3.6 or higher is installed. The required libraries can be installed via pip using the requirements.txt file.

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
The dataset contains the following columns:

Time: Time elapsed between the current transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
V1-V28: Anonymized features resulting from PCA transformation.
Amount: The transaction amount for the purchase.
Class: The target variable indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).
Preprocessing
The data preprocessing script (data_preprocessing.py) includes:

Handling missing values
Splitting data into training and testing sets
Balancing the dataset using techniques like SMOTE
Model Training

Train models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest
Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
Example usage:


Model Evaluation
The evaluation script (evaluation.py) provides a detailed report on model performance, including confusion matrix.

Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated based on the following metrics:

Accuracy: Proportion of total correct predictions (both fraudulent and non-fraudulent).
Precision: Proportion of positive predictions that were actually correct.
Recall: Proportion of actual fraudulent transactions correctly identified.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful when the class distribution is imbalanced.

Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the project:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
imbalanced-learn
jupyter
To install these dependencies, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Future Work
Model Improvement: Test with additional models like Neural Networks, SVM, etc.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Perform a deeper search for hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.
Real-time Prediction: Integrate the model into a real-time fraud detection system.
